        <h3>How Corona Spreads</h3>
        <p>The Coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) is a virus that is extremely contagious, and even though 80% of the cases are mild, 20% of the those infected have a
            serious case and might need to be hospitalized. Another reason that COVID-19 spreads so easily is because of how people can be carriers before they realize it.
            Those infected usually show symptoms around 5 days after they get infected, but they can infect others long before they show symptoms. The new people infected 
            then don't realize they are infected, and proceed in their normal lives, leading to the infection of much more people since people don't realize it until they
            show symptoms.

        <h3>Social Distancing</h3>
        <p>
            The solution to this problem of people not realizing they are infected is something called social distancing. This works to slow the spread of the virus because
            all people stay away from each other, preventing the exponential spreading by limiting the interactions of everyone, preventing the exponential spreading.
